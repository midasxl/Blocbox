@media only screen and (min-width: 330px) { ... }

This means if the actual device (tablet, smartphone, laptop) width is greater than or equal to
the specified min-width, then it returns true and the rulesets apply.

Another way to say it: If the device is AT LEAST as wide as the min-width (= or greater), then
it returns true, and the rulesets apply.

@media only screen and (max-width: 330px) { ... }

This means if the device width is less than or equal to the specified max-width, it returns true
and the rulesets apply.

Another way to say it: If the device is AT MOST as wide as the max-width (= or less), then it
returns true, and the rulesets apply.

Conclusion:
min-width is the miniumum width at which the styles will be applied. Anything less and it will be false.
max-width is the maxiumum width at which the styles will be applied. Anything more and it will be false.
